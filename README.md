## Setup Instructions

First install `node` if you haven't already. You can find it [here](https://nodejs.org/en/) for both windows and mac (and linux).

Clone the repository with

```
git clone https://github.com/abhisuri97/pennapps-2k17-sp-js.git
```

and then `cd` into the repository with `cd pennapps-2k17-sp-js`.

Next, run `npm install` to install all the required modules. If you have any issues either doing `sudo npm install` will work or (for windows users) running as administrator should fix things.

lastly run `node server.js` and you should be all set :) Look at `http://localhost:3000` for your app running locally.
